# Two-years-ProJ

***`contineously Updating`***

## Purpose
I started to learn about the python and Machine learning since March 13, 2022.
For two years, I will put myself on computer science to be an expert in the AI field. (In 25% of the high level.)
I hope to upload the great cords in open sources and act in the technology field, although I study wihtout regular courses (University Course) 
Here, the starting point would be the chart of growing rate of ability. 

## First year process
Before learning about computer languages, forming the basic knowledge and experience environment is significant for the long-journey of my life.
So, the first year would be the time of gathering information and learning hand-on experience. 

#### Putting myself on the wild environment - March to June
Programmers should be familer with English. Since the internet service publicized in the worldwide, data keeps storing in English. The release services and softwares are uploading in Enlish. And there is one more significant benefit, that is the higher communication with developers. The more advices of actual deveopers will keep our minds on the journey. 

Therefore, the process of three months would be:
- Researching how did others learn about computer programming. (Searching the successful programmers' blogs or autobiograhpy)
- Comparing the regular curriculums of the top universities and categorizing the basic and advence courses. (MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and UC Bukery)
- Understanding the terminologies and developing the math ability. 
- Analyzing the cord process through the small projects in open sourse. 'Open Source's cord is well organized'. 

#### Beginning & Applying - July to October
And from this time, I am gonna begin to do small projects. Then, my programming ability would pretty much increase. And I have to have some communication to know the recent state in the technology field. It would reduce the wasting times on the programming.

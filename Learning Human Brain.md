* * * 

### PURPOSE
We can develop our understanding about 'Machine Learning' and 'Neuron Engine' through understanding the basic of human brain. The human brain consisted with millions of the synopsises and neurons, and it conveys the data with comparing the existed knowledge. While the process passes through the neuron system, the more acurrate data remain among the lots of false data. Therefore, the learning the neuron system supports to build the more accurate Machine `Leaning system` and `Neuron Engine` in the computer.
